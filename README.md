This repository contains my solutions to the projects from *C Programming: A Modern Approach* by K. N. King.
## Structure
Each chapter has its own folder, with each project placed in its own subfolder. Projects are named according to their numbering in the book.  
## Usage/Compilation
To compile and run a project, use:
```sh
gcc -o output_file source_file.c
./output_file.exe
```
